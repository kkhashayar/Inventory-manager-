 
This is a simple data manager, i tried to use lists to keep and
manipulate data, for external database, i didn't use CSV format or any module
and database, so the external files are simple text files, i used 2 separate
text files for load - save to and from the list in the program,for GUI i used
tkinter, and pack instead of grid. the program need improvements so i'll
appreciate any thoughts, ideas or advices
